\begin{lemma}(Cauchy,Kronecker) Let $K$ be a field. For any irreducible polynomial $f$ in $K[X]$ there is an extension field of $K$ in which $f$ has a root.\end{lemma}\begin{proof} If $I$ is the ideal generated by $f$ in $K[X]$, since $f$ is irreducible, $I$ is a maximal ideal of $K[X]$, and consequently $K[X]/I$ is a field.\newline
 We can construct a canonical monomorphism $v$ from $K$ to $K[X]$. By tracking back the field operation on $K[X]/I$, $v$ can be extended to an isomorphism $w$ from an extension field $L$ of $K$ to $K[X]/I$.\newline
 We show that $\alpha = w^{-1}(X+I)$ is a root of $f$.\newline
 If we write $f = \sum_{i = 1}^n f_i X^i$ then $f+I = 0$ implies:
\begin{align*}
w(f(\alpha)) 
&= w(\sum_{i = 1}^n f_i \alpha^i) \\
&= \sum_{i = 1}^n w(f_i) w(\alpha)^i \\
&=  \sum_{i = 1}^n v(f_i) w(\alpha)^i \\
&= \sum_{i = 1}^n (f_i+I)(X+I)^i \\
&= (\sum_{i = 1}^n f_i X^i)+I \\ 
&= f + I = 0,
\end{align*} 
 which means that $f(\alpha) = 0$.\end{proof}
\begin{theorem} Let $K$ be a field and let $M$ be a finite set of nonconstant polynomials in $K[X]$. Then there exists an extension field $L$ of $K$ such that every polynomial in $M$ splits in $L[X]$\end{theorem}\begin{proof} If $L$ is a field extension of $K$ then the nonconstant polynomials $f_1, f_2, ... ,f_n$ split in $L[X]$ iff the polynomial $\prod_{i=1}^n f_i$ splits in $L[X]$. Now the proof easily follows from the above lemma.
\end{proof}
