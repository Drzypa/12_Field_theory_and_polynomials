\begin{document}
Let $K$ be a field and let $L$ be an algebraic closure of $K$. The {\em separable closure} of $K$ inside $L$ is the compositum of all finite separable extensions of $K$ contained in $L$ (that is to say, the smallest subfield of $L$ that contains every finite separable extension of $K$).
