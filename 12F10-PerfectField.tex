\begin{document}
A \emph{perfect field} is a field $K$ such that every algebraic extension field $L/K$ is separable over $K$.

All fields of characteristic 0 are perfect, so in particular the fields $\mathbb R$, $\mathbb C$ and $\mathbb Q$ are perfect.  If $K$ is a field of characteristic $p$ (with $p$ a prime number), then $K$ is perfect if and only if the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ on $K$, defined by
$$
F(x)=x^p\quad(x\in K),
$$
is an automorphism of $K$.  Since the Frobenius map is always injective, it is sufficient to check whether $F$ is surjective.  In particular, all finite fields are perfect (any injective endomorphism is also surjective).  Moreover, any field whose characteristic is nonzero that is \PMlinkname{algebraic}{AlgebraicExtension} over its prime subfield is perfect.  Thus, the only fields that are not perfect are those whose characteristic is nonzero and are transcendental over their prime subfield.

Similarly, a ring $R$ of characteristic $p$ is perfect if the endomorphism $x\mapsto x^p$ of $R$ is an {\it automorphism} (i.e., is surjective).
