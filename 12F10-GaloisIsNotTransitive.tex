\begin{document}
The phrase ``Galois is not transitive'' is a mnemonic for the statement ``The relation `is a Galois extension of' is not transitive.''  This means that, if $K/F$ and $L/K$ are \PMlinkname{Galois extensions}{GaloisExtension}, it does not follow that $L/F$ is Galois.  This follows immediately from the fact that normal is not transitive.  See example of normal extension for more details.
