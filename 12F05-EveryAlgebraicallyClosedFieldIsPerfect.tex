\begin{proposition} Every algebraically closed field is perfect \end{proposition}\begin{proof}
 Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic $p$. Take $a\in K$. Then the polynomial $X^p-a$ admits a zero in $K$. It follows that $a$ admits a $p$th root in $K$. Since $a$ is arbitrary we have proved that the field $K$ is perfect.\end{proof}
