\begin{document}
\begin{cor} Let $E/K$ be a Galois extension of fields, let $F/K$ be an arbitrary extension and assume that $E$ and $F$ are both subfields of some other larger field $T$. The compositum of $E$ and $F$ is here denoted by $EF$. Then $[EF:F] = [E:E\cap F]$.
\end{cor}

This follows immediately from item (2) of the theorem.
