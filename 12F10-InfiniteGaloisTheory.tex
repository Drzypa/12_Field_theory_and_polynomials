Let $L/F$ be a Galois extension, not necessarily finite dimensional.

\section{Topology on the Galois group}

Recall that the \emph{Galois group} $G := \Gal(L/F)$ of $L/F$ is the
group of all field automorphisms $\sigma: L \lra L$ that restrict to
the identity map on $F$, under the group operation of composition. In
the case where the extension $L/F$ is infinite dimensional, the group
$G$ comes equipped with a natural topology, which plays a key role in
the statement of the Galois correspondence.

We define a subset $U$ of $G$ to be open if, for each $\sigma \in U$,
there exists an intermediate field $K \subset L$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item The degree $[K:F]$ is finite,
\item If $\sigma'$ is another element of $G$, and the restrictions
  $\sigma|_K$ and $\sigma'|_K$ are equal, then $\sigma' \in U$.
\end{itemize}

The resulting collection of open sets forms a topology on $G$, called
the \emph{Krull topology}, and $G$ is a topological group under the
Krull topology.  Another way to define the topology is to state that
the subgroups $\Gal(L/K)$ for finite extensions $K/F$ form a neighborhood
basis for $\Gal(L/F)$ at the identity.

\section{Inverse limit structure}

In this section we exhibit the group $G$ as a projective limit of an
inverse system of finite groups. This construction shows that the
Galois group $G$ is actually a profinite group.

Let $\A$ denote the set of finite normal extensions $K$ of $F$ which
are contained in $L$. The set $\A$ is a partially ordered set under
the inclusion relation. Form the inverse limit
$$
\Gamma := \ilim \Gal(K/F) \subset \prod_{K \in \A} \Gal(K/F)
$$
consisting, as usual, of the set of all $(\sigma_K) \in \prod_K
\Gal(K/F)$ such that $\sigma_{K'}|_K = \sigma_K$ for all $K,K' \in \A$
with $K \subset K'$. We make $\Gamma$ into a topological space by
putting the discrete topology on each finite set $\Gal(K/F)$ and
giving $\Gamma$ the subspace topology induced by the product topology
on $\prod_K \Gal(K/F)$. The group $\Gamma$ is a closed subset of the
compact group $\prod_K \Gal(K/F)$, and is therefore compact.

Let
$$
\phi: G \lra \prod_{K \in \A} \Gal(K/F)
$$
be the group homomorphism which sends an element $\sigma \in G$ to the
element $(\sigma_K)$ of $\prod_K \Gal(K/F)$ whose $K$--th coordinate
is the automorphism $\sigma|_K \in \Gal(K/F)$. Then the function
$\phi$ has image equal to $\Gamma$ and in fact is a homeomorphism
between $G$ and $\Gamma$. Since $\Gamma$ is profinite, it follows that
$G$ is profinite as well.

\section{The Galois correspondence}

\begin{theorem}[Galois correspondence for infinite extensions]
Let $G$, $L$, $F$ be as before. For every closed subgroup $H$ of $G$,
  let $L^H$ denote the fixed field of $H$. The correspondence
$$
K \mapsto \Gal(L/K),
$$
defined for all intermediate field extensions $F \subset K \subset L$,
is an inclusion reversing bijection between the set of all
intermediate extensions $K$ and the set of all closed subgroups of
$G$. Its inverse is the correspondence
$$
H \mapsto L^H,
$$
defined for all closed subgroups $H$ of $G$. The extension $K/F$ is
normal if and only if $\Gal(L/K)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, and in
this case the restriction map
$$
G \lra \Gal(K/F)
$$
has kernel $\Gal(L/K)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Galois correspondence for finite subextensions]
Let $G$, $L$, $F$ be as before.
\begin{itemize}
\item Every open subgroup $H \subset G$ is closed and has finite index
  in $G$.
\item If $H \subset G$ is an open subgroup, then the field extension
  $L^H/F$ is finite.
\item For every intermediate field $K$ with $[K:F]$ finite, the Galois
  group $\Gal(L/K)$ is an open subgroup of $G$.
\end{itemize}
