\begin{document}
The {\em quadratic resolvent} of the cubic equation
\begin{align}
y^3+py+q = 0,
\end{align}
where $p$ and $q$ are known complex numbers, is the auxiliary equation
$$z^2+qz-\left(\frac{p}{3}\right)^3 = 0$$
determining as its \PMlinkname{roots}{Equation}
$$z_1 = u^3, \qquad z_2 = v^3$$
the numbers $u$ and $v$ whose sum \,$y = u+v$\, satisfies the
equation (1).\, See 
\PMlinkname{example of solving a cubic equation}{exampleofsolvingacubicequation}.

Analogically, a quartic equation has a {\em cubic resolvent} (resolvent cubic) equation.
