Let $F$ be a field.  A field extension $K$ of $F$ is called a \emph{Pythagorean extension} if $K = F(\sqrt{1+\alpha^2})$ for some $\alpha$ in $F$, where $\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}$ denotes a root of the polynomial $x^2-(1+\alpha^2)$ in the algebraic closure $\overline{F}$ of $F$.  A field $F$ is \emph{Pythagorean} if every Pythagorean extension of $F$ is $F$ itself.  

The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$F$ is Pythagorean
\item
Every sum of two squares in $F$ is a square
\item
Every sum of (finite number of) squares in $F$ is a square
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ are Pythagorean.
\item
$\mathbb{Q}$ is not Pythagorean.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Remark}.  Every field is contained in some Pythagorean field.  The smallest Pythagorean field over a field $F$ is called the \emph{Pythagorean closure} of $F$, and is written $F_{py}$.  Given a field $F$, one way to construct its Pythagorean closure is as follows: let $K$ be an extension over $F$ such that there is a tower
$$F=K_1\subseteq K_2\subseteq \cdots \subseteq K_n=K$$
of fields with $K_{i+1}=K_i(\sqrt{1+\alpha_i^2})$ for some $\alpha_i\in K_i$, where $i=1,\ldots,n-1$.  Take the compositum $L$ of the family $\mathcal{K}$ of all such $K$'s.  Then $L=F_{py}$.
