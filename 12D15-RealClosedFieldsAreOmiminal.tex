\begin{document}
It is clear that the axioms for a structure to be an ordered field can be written in $L$, the first order language of ordered rings.  It is also true that the condition 
\begin{quote}
for each odd degree polynomial $p \in K[x]$, $p$ has a root
\end{quote}
can be written in a schema of first order sentences in this language.


Let $A$ be all these sentences together with one that states that all positive elements have a square root. 
Then one can show that the consequences of $A$ are a complete theory $T$. 
It is clear that this theory is the theory of the real numbers. We call any $L$ structure a {\em real closed field} (which can be defined purely algebraically also, see \PMlinkname{here}{RealClosed}).

\medskip

The {\em semi algebraic sets} on a real closed field are Boolean combinations of solution sets of polynomial equalities and inequalities.  
Tarski showed that $T$ has quantifier elimination, which is equivalent to the class of semi algebraic sets being closed under projection. 

\medskip

Let $K$ be a real closed field.  Consider the definable subsets of $K$.  By quantifier elimination, 
each is definable by a quantifier free formula, i.e. a boolean combination of atomic formulas. 
An atomic formula in one variable has one of the following forms:
\begin{itemize} \item $f(x)>g(x)$ for some $f,g \in K[x]$
\item $f(x)=g(x)$ for some $f,g \in K[x]$.
\end{itemize}
The first defines a finite union of intervals, the second defines a finite union of points. Every definable subset of $K$ is a finite union of these kinds of sets, so is a finite union of intervals and points.
Thus any real closed field is o-minimal.
