\begin{document}
Let $F$ be a field of characteristic $p > 0$ and let $\alpha$ be an element which is algebraic over $F$.  Then $\alpha$ is said to be \emph{purely inseparable} over $F$ if $\alpha^{p^n} \in F$ for some $n \ge 0$.

An algebraic field extension $K/F$ is \emph{purely inseparable} if each element of $K$ is purely inseparable over $F$.

Purely inseparable extensions have the following property: if $K/F$ is purely inseparable, and $A$ is an algebraic closure of $F$ which contains $K$, then any homomorphism $K \to A$ which fixes $F$ necessarily fixes $K$.

Let $K/F$ be an arbitrary algebraic extension.  Then there is an intermediate field $E$ such that $K/E$ is purely inseparable, and $E/F$ is separable.


\begin{example}
Let $s$ be an indeterminate, and let $K = \F_3(s)$ where $\F_3$ is the finite field with $3$ elements.  Let $F = \F_3(s^6)$.  Then $K/F$ is neither separable, nor purely inseparable.  Let $E = \F_3(s^3)$.  Then $E/F$ is separable, and $K/E$ is purely inseparable.
