Let $K$ be a field and $E$ an extension field of $K$.\, If $\alpha 
\in E$, then the smallest subfield of $E$, that contains $K$ and 
$\alpha$, is denoted by  $K(\alpha)$.\, We say that $K(\alpha)$ is 
obtained from the field $K$ by {\em adjoining} the element $\alpha$ 
to $K$ via {\em field adjunction}.\\

\textbf{Theorem.}\, $K(\alpha)$ is identical with the quotient field $Q$ of $K[\alpha]$.

{\it Proof.}  (1)  Because $K[\alpha]$ is an integral domain (as a subring of the field $E$), all possible quotients of the elements of $K[\alpha]$ belong to $E$. So we have
  $$K\cup\{\alpha\} \subseteq K[\alpha] \subseteq Q \subseteq E,$$
and because $K(\alpha)$ was the smallest, then \,$K(\alpha) \subseteq Q.$

(2)  $K(\alpha)$ is a subring of $E$ containing $K$ and $\alpha$, therefore also the whole ring $K[\alpha]$, that is, \,$K[\alpha] \subseteq K(\alpha)$. \,And because $K(\alpha)$ is a field, it must contain all possible quotients of the elements of $K[\alpha]$, i.e., \,$Q \subseteq K(\alpha)$.\\


In \PMlinkescapetext{addition} to the adjunction of one single element, we can adjoin to $K$ an arbitrary subset $S$ of $E$:\, the resulting field $K(S)$ is the smallest of such subfields of $E$, i.e. the intersection of such subfields of $E$, that contain both $K$ and $S$.\, We say that $K(S)$ is obtained from $K$ by adjoining the set $S$ to it.\, Naturally,
                    $$K \subseteq K(S) \subseteq E.$$
The field $K(S)$ contains all elements of $K$ and $S$, and being a field, also all such elements that can be formed via addition, subtraction, multiplication and division from the elements of $K$ and $S$.\, But such elements constitute a field, which therefore must be equal with $K(S)$.\, Accordingly, we have the

\textbf{Theorem.}\, $K(S)$ constitutes of all rational expressions formed of the elements of the field $K$ with the elements of the set $S$.\\


\textbf{Notes.}

1. $K(S)$ is the union of all fields $K(T)$ where $T$ is a finite subset of $S$.\\
2. $K(S_1 \cup S_2) = K(S_1)(S_2)$.\\
3. If, especially, $S$ also is a subfield of $E$, then one may denote\, $K(S) = KS$.
