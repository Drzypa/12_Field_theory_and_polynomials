\begin{proposition} If $K$ is a field, the following are equivalent:\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] $K$ is algebraically closed, i.e. every nonconstant polynomial $f$ in $K[x]$ has a root in $K$.
\item[(2)] Every nonconstant polynomial $f$ in $K[x]$ splits completely over $K$.
\item[(3)] If $L|K$ is an algebraic extension then $L = K$.\end{enumerate}\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
 If (1) is true then we can prove by induction on degree of $f$ that every nonconstant polynomial $f$ splits completely over $K$. Conversely, (2)$\Rightarrow$ (1) is trivial.\newline
(2)$\Rightarrow$ (3) If $L|K$ is algebraic and $\alpha\in L$, then $\alpha$ is a root of a polynomial $f\in K[x]$. By (2) $f$ splits over $K$, which implies that $\alpha\in K$. It follows that $L=K$.\newline
(3)$\Rightarrow$ (1) Let $f\in K[x]$ and $\alpha$ a root of $f$ (in some extension of $K$). Then $K(\alpha)$ is an algebraic extension of $K$, hence  $\alpha\in K$.
\end{proof} 
\textbf{Examples} 1) The field of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ is not algebraically closed. Consider the equation $x^2+1=0$. The square of a real number is always positive and cannot be $-1$ so the equation has no roots.\newline
2) The $p$-adic field $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is not algebraically closed because the equation $x^2-p=0$ has no roots. Otherwise $x^2=p$ implies $2v_{p}x = 1$, which is false.
