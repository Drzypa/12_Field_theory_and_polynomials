\textbf{Proof:}
We can write $P(x)$ as
\[P(x) = a_n(x-r_1)(x-r_2)\ldots(x-r_n) = a_n(x^n - S_1x^{n-1} + S_2x^{n-2} - \ldots + (-1)^nS_n).\]
Since we also have that 
\[P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots a_{1}x + a_{0},\]
setting the coefficients equal yields
\[a_n(-1)^{i}S_i = a_{n-i}\]
which is what the theorem stated.
